			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a Front End Developer based in the SF Bay Area looking for new opportunities.</p>
			<p>After completing my MBA, I became interested in the web and how it is built. I turned my free time to learning the big 3 web technologies, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Turns out, I really enjoy development and have continued my self guided by education as much as my schedule allows. My goal is to get experience on a professional project and become a full time developer. I beleive in writing clean, readable code, using the right tool for the job, and am open to new frameworks and technologies.</p>

			<p>Take a look at some stuff I'm working on at <a href="www.github.com/fsites">GitHub</a>, or say hi on <a href="#contact">social media</a>.</p>
